# Oil-Price-Prediction
Oil prices predictions traded on NYMEX (New York Mercantile Exchange) using time-varying approach.

As the title itself is very subjective, there are much more than just a price to predict the market
movements of the oil such as GDP growth, Inflation rate, Industrial growth, etc. along with some arbitrary
factors which cannot be collected in the form of data such as political factor (e.g. The former US President
Donald Trumpâ€™s tweet caused oil prices tumbled more than 3% at OPEC). Anyway, the model which I had
tried in this project is time-series models, i.e. AR (Autoregressive), ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated
Moving Average), and FbProphet and Linear Regression.

Overall, FbProphet has performed well.
